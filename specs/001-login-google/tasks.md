# Tasks: Login com Google (OAuth 2.0)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-login-google/`
**Prerequisites**: impl-plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for this feature as specified in the constitution (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

-  **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
-  **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
-  Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions (Laravel Project)

-  **Backend**: `app/`, `database/`, `routes/`, `config/`
-  **Tests**: `tests/Feature/`, `tests/Unit/`
-  **Views**: `resources/views/`
-  **Config**: `config/`

-  [ ] T003 [P] Set up Google Cloud Console credentials and configuration

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-  **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-  **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
-  **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
   -  User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
   -  Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
-  **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

-  **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
-  **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
-  **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
-  **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after US1 is complete - Depends on basic OAuth flow
-  **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after US1 is complete - Depends on basic OAuth flow

### Within Each User Story

-  Tests (REQUIRED) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
-  Models/migrations before services
-  Services before controllers
-  Controllers before views
-  Core implementation before integration
-  Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

-  All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
-  All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
-  Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1, 2, and 3 can start in parallel
-  All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
-  Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
-  Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   -  Developer A: User Story 1 (P1)
   -  Developer B: User Story 2 (P2)
   -  Developer C: User Story 3 (P3)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

-  [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
-  [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
-  Each user story should be independently completable and testable
-  Verify tests fail before implementing
-  Commit after each task or logical group
-  Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
-  Follow Laravel conventions and existing architecture patterns
-  All authentication must respect multi-tenant isolation
-  All operations must be audited according to system standards
-  Tests are NON-NEGOTIABLE per constitution requirements
