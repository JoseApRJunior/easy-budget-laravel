## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies (Updated for Partial Migration)

-  **Phase 0**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - No dependencies
-  **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Foundation already implemented
-  **Phase 2**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Depends on Phase 1 (already complete)

-  **Phase 4**: ‚è≥ PENDING - Depends on Phase 3 completion

### Task Dependencies

-  **Remaining Tasks**: Focus on completing partially implemented features
-  **Integration Tasks**: Complete external integrations (Mercado Pago, advanced email)
-  **Optimization Tasks**: Performance and security enhancements
-  **Migration Tasks**: Data migration and legacy system transition
-  **Tests before implementation** for each remaining task (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Parallel Opportunities

-  **Phase 2 Remaining Tasks**: T020, T021, T025, T029 can run in parallel (different modules)

-  **Phase 4 Tasks**: Most tasks can run in parallel (optimization, testing, documentation)
-  **Testing**: All tests for remaining tasks can run in parallel
-  **Different modules** (CRM, Financial, Reporting) can be completed in parallel by different team members

## Notes

-  [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies (can run in parallel)
-  **Current State**: Foundation (Phase 0 + Phase 1) is complete, core features (Phase 2) are partially implemented
-  **Focus**: Complete remaining Phase 2 tasks, then proceed to Phase 3 and Phase 4
-  Each phase should be independently completable and testable
-  Verify tests fail before implementing remaining features
-  Commit after each task or logical group
-  Stop at any checkpoint to validate phase independently
-  Follow Laravel conventions and existing architecture patterns (already established)
-  All operations must respect multi-tenant isolation (TenantScoped trait implemented)
-  All operations must be audited according to system standards (Auditable trait implemented)
-  Tests are NON-NEGOTIABLE per constitution requirements
-  **Migration Completion**: Preserve data integrity during final migration from legacy system
-  **Parallel Operation**: Maintain both systems operational until migration is complete
-  **Rollback Ready**: Ensure rollback procedures are tested and ready
