# Tasks: Easy Budget Platform

**Input**: Implementation plan from `/specs/002-easy-budget-platform/plan.md`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for this feature as specified in the constitution (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by implementation phase to enable independent implementation and testing of each phase.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Phase] Description`

-  **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
-  **[Phase]**: Which phase this task belongs to (e.g., Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2)
-  Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions (Laravel Project)

-  **Backend**: `app/`, `database/`, `routes/`, `config/`
-  **Tests**: `tests/Feature/`, `tests/Unit/`
-  **Views**: `resources/views/`
-  **Config**: `config/`

---

## Phase 0: Legacy System Analysis and Migration Planning

**Purpose**: Analyze the existing legacy system and plan the migration strategy.

-  [ ] T002 [P] Plan data migration strategy with integrity checks
-  [ ] T003 [P] Identify dependencies and integration points
-  [ ] T004 Set up parallel operation environment
-  [ ] T005 Define rollback procedures and transition timeline

---

## Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish core infrastructure that supports all platform features.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No feature work can begin until this phase is complete

-  [ ] T006 Configure multi-tenant architecture with Stancl/Tenancy

-  [ ] T008 [P] Implement ServiceResult pattern for consistent responses
-  [ ] T009 [P] Configure Google OAuth 2.0 with Laravel Socialite
-  [ ] T010 Set up audit logging system with severity and categories
-  [ ] T011 Create base repository and service abstractions
-  [ ] T012 Implement rate limiting middleware
-  [ ] T013 Set up email system with MailerService

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - feature implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 2: Core Platform Features (MVP)

**Purpose**: Deliver essential business management features.

### User Management

-  [ ] T014 Implement user registration and authentication
-  [ ] T015 [P] Create tenant creation and management
-  [ ] T016 [P] Set up RBAC with roles and permissions
-  [ ] T017 Implement profile management and settings

### CRM Module

-  [ ] T018 Create customer models and repositories
-  [ ] T019 [P] Implement customer CRUD operations
-  [ ] T020 [P] Add customer interaction tracking
-  [ ] T021 Set up customer segmentation and tags

### Financial Management

-  [ ] T022 Implement budget models and services
-  [ ] T023 [P] Create budget creation and approval workflows
-  [ ] T024 [P] Set up invoice generation from budgets
-  [ ] T025 Implement payment tracking and status updates

### Reporting and Analytics

-  [ ] T026 Create reporting services with caching
-  [ ] T027 [P] Implement dashboard with KPIs
-  [ ] T028 [P] Add export functionality (PDF/Excel)
-  [ ] T029 Set up automated insights and recommendations

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Integration

**Purpose**: Enhance platform with advanced capabilities and external integrations.

-  [ ] T030 Integrate Mercado Pago for subscriptions and payments
-  [ ] T031 [P] Implement product catalog and inventory management
-  [ ] T032 [P] Add advanced reporting and analytics
-  [ ] T033 Set up automation workflows and notifications
-  [ ] T034 Implement email system evolution (metrics, A/B testing)

---

## Phase 4: Polish and Optimization

**Purpose**: Final optimizations, security hardening, and performance tuning.

-  [ ] T035 Performance optimization (caching, query optimization)
-  [ ] T036 [P] Security hardening and compliance checks
-  [ ] T037 [P] Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, feature)
-  [ ] T038 Documentation updates and user guides
-  [ ] T039 Deployment configuration and staging validation

---

## Testing Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Tests must be written BEFORE implementation for each task

### Unit Tests

-  Models, services, repositories
-  Authentication and authorization
-  Multi-tenant isolation
-  Audit logging

### Feature Tests

-  Complete user workflows (registration to dashboard)
-  Budget creation to invoice generation
-  CRM operations
-  Reporting and exports

### Integration Tests

-  Google OAuth flows
-  Mercado Pago integration
-  Email system
-  Multi-tenant data isolation

**Coverage Goal**: 80% minimum across all components

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-  **Phase 0**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-  **Phase 1**: Depends on Phase 0 completion - BLOCKS all other phases
-  **Phase 2**: Depends on Phase 1 completion
-  **Phase 3**: Depends on Phase 2 completion
-  **Phase 4**: Depends on Phase 3 completion

### Task Dependencies

-  Foundation tasks (Phase 1) must complete before any feature tasks
-  Models before services
-  Services before controllers
-  Controllers before views
-  Core implementation before integration
-  Tests before implementation for each task

### Parallel Opportunities

-  All Phase 0 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
-  All Phase 1 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within phase)
-  Once Phase 1 completes, Phase 2 modules can be worked on in parallel
-  All tests for a task marked [P] can run in parallel
-  Different modules (CRM, Financial, Reporting) can be developed in parallel by different team members

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Basic Phase 2)

1. Complete Phase 0: Legacy Analysis
2. Complete Phase 1: Foundation (CRITICAL - blocks all features)
3. Complete core user management and basic CRM (Phase 2)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test basic functionality independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Phase 0 + Phase 1 → Foundation ready
2. Add core features (Phase 2) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add advanced features (Phase 3) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Polish and optimize (Phase 4) → Final release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phase 0 + Phase 1 together
2. Once Phase 1 is done:
   -  Developer A: User Management (Phase 2)
   -  Developer B: CRM Module (Phase 2)
   -  Developer C: Financial Management (Phase 2)
3. Integrate and test independently

## Notes

-  [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
-  Each phase should be independently completable and testable
-  Verify tests fail before implementing
-  Commit after each task or logical group
-  Stop at any checkpoint to validate phase independently
-  Follow Laravel conventions and existing architecture patterns
-  All operations must respect multi-tenant isolation
-  All operations must be audited according to system standards
-  Tests are NON-NEGOTIABLE per constitution requirements
-  Migration from legacy system must preserve data integrity
