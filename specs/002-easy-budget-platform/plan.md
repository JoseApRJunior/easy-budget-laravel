# Implementation Plan: Easy Budget Platform

**Branch**: `002-easy-budget-platform` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: [specs/002-easy-budget-platform/spec.md](specs/002-easy-budget-platform/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-easy-budget-platform/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The Easy Budget Platform is a comprehensive business management solution for service providers and SMEs, providing integrated CRM, financial control, budgeting, invoicing, and reporting with multi-tenant architecture. The implementation will follow Laravel's MVC with Service Layer and Repository Pattern, ensuring multi-tenant isolation, comprehensive auditing, and adherence to security best practices including Google OAuth integration. The plan focuses on delivering core platform features in phases, starting with foundational infrastructure and progressing to user-facing functionalities, with mandatory testing at each step.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: PHP 8.3+
**Primary Dependencies**: Laravel 12, Laravel Sanctum, Laravel Socialite, Mercado Pago SDK, mPDF, PHPSpreadsheet, Stancl/Tenancy
**Storage**: MySQL 8.0+ with InnoDB engine, Redis 7.0+ for caching
**Testing**: PHPUnit for unit and feature tests, minimum 80% coverage required
**Target Platform**: Web application (desktop, tablet, mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Page load < 2s, API response < 200ms, support for 10,000 concurrent users
**Constraints**: Multi-tenant isolation, LGPD compliance, OWASP Top 10 adherence, offline-capable where possible
**Scale/Scope**: Support for 1,000+ active businesses, 1M+ financial transactions per month

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected based on Laravel framework requirements. The layout follows standard Laravel conventions with additional organization for multi-tenant architecture, design patterns, and modular views by business domain.

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

No violations detected. The implementation aligns with all constitutional requirements for architecture, security, testing, and development flow.

## Implementation Phases

Based on the feature specification and existing architecture, the implementation is broken down into phases to ensure incremental delivery and testing.

-  [ ] T032 Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, feature)
-  [ ] T033 Documentation updates and user guides
-  [ ] T034 Deployment configuration and staging validation

## Testing Strategy

All phases require mandatory testing as per constitution:

-  **Unit Tests**: For models, services, and repositories
-  **Feature Tests**: For complete user workflows
-  **Integration Tests**: For multi-tenant isolation and external integrations
-  **Minimum Coverage**: 80% across all components
-  **Test First**: Write tests before implementation for each task

## Risk Mitigation

-  **Multi-tenant Isolation**: All operations must respect tenant boundaries
-  **Security**: Implement protections against common vulnerabilities
-  **Performance**: Monitor and optimize for scale requirements
-  **Compliance**: Ensure LGPD/GDPR adherence in data handling
-  **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to rollback changes if issues arise

## Success Metrics

-  All constitutional requirements met
-  Feature specification fully implemented
-  Tests passing with required coverage
-  Performance goals achieved
-  User acceptance testing completed
-  Documentation updated

This plan provides a structured approach to implementing the Easy Budget Platform while maintaining alignment with project standards and ensuring quality delivery.
