# Easy Budget Platform - Feature Specification

## Feature Overview

The Easy Budget Platform is a comprehensive business management solution designed for service providers and small to medium enterprises (SMEs). It addresses the critical need for integrated tools that eliminate fragmented management processes, providing a single platform for customer relationship management (CRM), financial control, budgeting, invoicing, and reporting. The platform enables users to streamline administrative tasks, automate workflows, and make data-driven decisions through real-time insights, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface that requires minimal training.

The platform supports multi-tenant architecture, ensuring complete data isolation between businesses, and includes robust security features like comprehensive auditing and secure authentication. It aims to reduce administrative overhead by 60% while improving operational efficiency and business growth for service providers.

## Legacy System Business Logic

The legacy system at `C:\xampp\htdocs\easy-budget-laravel\old-system` is a budget management system built with Twig templates and DoctrineDBAL. It provides the following core features:

- **User Management:** Creation and management of service providers and clients
- **Authentication:** User login and authorization
- **Budget Management:** Creation, editing, and tracking of budgets
- **Templating:** Dynamic views using Twig
- **Middleware:** Custom request handling
- **Database:** Abstraction layer with DoctrineDBAL

The new Laravel system migrates these features to modern architecture while preserving the business logic.

## Migration Context

This platform implementation represents the **completion of the partial migration** from the existing legacy system located at `C:\xampp\htdocs\easy-budget-laravel\old-system` (Twig + DoctrineDBAL) to Laravel 12 with modern architecture. The project has already been partially migrated, with core components like controllers, services, models, and database migrations already implemented in Laravel. The remaining work focuses on completing the migration, ensuring full feature parity, and optimizing the modernized system.

**Current State (Partially Migrated):**

-  **Already Implemented in Laravel 12:**
-  Core controllers (BudgetController, CustomerController, DashboardController, etc.)
-  Service layer (BudgetCalculationService, EmailVerificationService, etc.)
-  Models with Eloquent ORM and multi-tenant traits
-  Database migrations with 50+ tables
-  Authentication system with Google OAuth integration
-  Email system with templates and notifications
-  Multi-tenant architecture with TenantScoped trait
-  Audit logging with Auditable trait
-  API endpoints for core functionality

-  **Legacy System Details:**
-  Location: `C:\xampp\htdocs\easy-budget-laravel\old-system`
-  Technology: Twig templates + DoctrineDBAL
-  Status: Still operational (parallel operation during transition)
-  Migration Scope: Complete remaining modules and full transition to Laravel

**Migration Strategy:**

-  **Incremental Completion:** Focus on migrating remaining features and modules not yet converted
-  **Parallel Operation:** Maintain both systems operational during transition
-  **Data Synchronization:** Ensure data consistency between legacy and new system
-  **Testing and Validation:** Comprehensive testing of migrated features
-  **Gradual Rollout:** Phased transition with rollback capability
-  **Legacy Decommissioning:** Plan for eventual shutdown of legacy system

## Assumptions

1. **Partial Migration State:** The project is already partially migrated to Laravel 12, with core components (controllers, services, models, database) implemented. The remaining work focuses on completing the migration and optimizing the system.

2. **Data Retention:** Financial and audit data will be retained for 7 years to comply with standard business record-keeping requirements, unless otherwise specified by users.

3. **Authentication Method:** The platform already has Google OAuth integration and session-based authentication implemented. Multi-factor authentication is available as an option for enhanced security.

4. **Integration Capabilities:** The platform already supports RESTful API integrations with Mercado Pago for payments and email services for notifications, using industry-standard protocols.

5. **Performance Benchmarks:** Default performance targets are based on standard web application expectations (e.g., sub-2-second page loads) and can be adjusted based on specific business needs. Current implementation already includes caching with Redis and query optimization.

6. **User Training:** The platform assumes users have basic computer literacy; advanced features include contextual help and tooltips to minimize the learning curve. Migration will maintain familiar workflows from the legacy system.

7. **Scalability:** The system is designed to handle growth from small businesses to medium enterprises, with multi-tenant architecture supporting independent scaling per tenant. Current implementation already includes this architecture.

8. **Legacy Compatibility:** During the migration completion, both legacy and new systems will operate in parallel to ensure business continuity and data integrity.

## Out of Scope

1. **Mobile Native Applications:** While the platform must be mobile-responsive, dedicated native mobile apps are not included in this specification.

2. **Advanced AI/ML Features:** Predictive analytics and machine learning insights beyond basic reporting are deferred to future phases.

3. **International Expansion:** Multi-language support and international compliance features are not part of the initial scope.

4. **Third-Party Marketplace:** Building or integrating a marketplace for business services is outside this feature's boundaries.

5. **Hardware Integration:** Direct integration with physical devices (e.g., point-of-sale systems, IoT devices) is not included.

## Dependencies

1. **External Services:** Complete integration with payment processors (Mercado Pago already implemented) and email services for notifications (MailerService already functional).

2. **Infrastructure:** Reliable hosting environment supporting multi-tenant architecture (already implemented) and high availability with Redis caching.

3. **Compliance Requirements:** Adherence to data protection regulations (e.g., LGPD in Brazil) for handling personal and financial information (audit logging already implemented).

4. **User Feedback:** Ongoing user testing and feedback loops to validate and refine migrated features post-completion.

5. **Team Resources:** Development team with expertise in Laravel 12, multi-tenant architecture, and migration from legacy systems.

6. **Legacy System Access:** Continued access to the legacy system during migration completion for data validation and parallel operation.

7. **Testing Infrastructure:** Comprehensive testing environment to validate migrated features against legacy system functionality.
