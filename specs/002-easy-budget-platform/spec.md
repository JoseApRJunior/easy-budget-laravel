# Easy Budget Platform - Feature Specification

## Feature Overview

The Easy Budget Platform is a comprehensive business management solution designed for service providers and small to medium enterprises (SMEs). It addresses the critical need for integrated tools that eliminate fragmented management processes, providing a single platform for customer relationship management (CRM), financial control, budgeting, invoicing, and reporting. The platform enables users to streamline administrative tasks, automate workflows, and make data-driven decisions through real-time insights, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface that requires minimal training.

The platform supports multi-tenant architecture, ensuring complete data isolation between businesses, and includes robust security features like comprehensive auditing and secure authentication. It aims to reduce administrative overhead by 60% while improving operational efficiency and business growth for service providers.

## Migration Context

This platform implementation represents the migration from the existing legacy system located at `C:\xampp\htdocs\easy-budget-laravel\old-system` (Twig + DoctrineDBAL) to Laravel 12 with modern architecture. The migration preserves all business logic while modernizing the technical stack, ensuring data integrity and user continuity.

**Legacy System Details:**

-  Location: `C:\xampp\htdocs\easy-budget-laravel\old-system`
-  Technology: Twig templates + DoctrineDBAL
-  Status: Fully operational (production system)
-  Migration Scope: Complete conversion to Laravel 12 with Eloquent ORM

**Migration Strategy:**

-  Gradual feature migration with parallel operation
-  Data migration with integrity validation
-  User training and transition support
-  Rollback capability during transition period
